# Anti-V-Checker-Solution


Anti-V Solution Software is a very useful software for people who want to check and ensure that the file they had downloaded is malicious or not. Anti-V Solution Software provides user flexibility to search, check and find the file’s intention from database. It provides the complete details of the virus type and version if get found.
My software “Anti-V Solutions” makes finding viruses easy. Files from any type can be scanned by this software. Simple Web API are used for scanning files from database. From the time of origin and still existence can be found by this software. With the database of thousand of hashes of viruses, users get a good assurity about the file. It also has a database of  details about the viruses so after the detection it will give the output as the details of the viruses.

This project is unlicenced and free to use to anyone who wants to make a carrer in cyber security, my best wishes is with them.
